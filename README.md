# CCP Kernel Datapath

This repository is a Linux kernel module that allows the Linux kernel to be used as a CCP datapath.

For instructions on building this module and running CCP, 
please see our [guide](https://ccp-project.github.io/guide).


## Notes

- We support Linux kernel versions 4.13 to 4.16. For later kernel versions,
you may be interested in [our patch](https://github.com/ngsrinivas/linux-fork/),
which [is being upstreamed](https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/941532/).
